# Deployment Checklist

## Pre-deployment Checks
- [ ] Private key is properly formatted and secure
- [ ] Sufficient LSK balance in wallet
- [ ] Network connection is stable
- [ ] All contract tests are passing
- [ ] Gas price is reasonable
- [ ] Contract bytecode is verified
- [ ] Environment variables are properly set

## Security Measures
1. **Private Key Security**
   - [ ] Private key is stored in `.env` file
   - [ ] `.env` is in `.gitignore`
   - [ ] No private key in commit history
   - [ ] Private key backup is secure

2. **Network Security**
   - [ ] Using correct network (testnet/mainnet)
   - [ ] RPC endpoint is secure
   - [ ] Network is stable and synced

3. **Contract Security**
   - [ ] Contracts are audited
   - [ ] No known vulnerabilities
   - [ ] Access controls are properly set
   - [ ] Emergency pause functions are tested

4. **Deployment Security**
   - [ ] Deployment script is verified
   - [ ] Constructor arguments are correct
   - [ ] Gas limits are appropriate
   - [ ] Transaction confirmation is monitored

## Post-deployment Verification
- [ ] All contracts are deployed successfully
- [ ] Contract addresses are saved
- [ ] Contracts are verified on block explorer
- [ ] Initial setup is completed
- [ ] Frontend is updated with new addresses
- [ ] Test transactions are successful

## Emergency Procedures
1. **If deployment fails**
   - [ ] Check error logs
   - [ ] Verify network status
   - [ ] Check gas prices
   - [ ] Verify wallet balance

2. **If contract verification fails**
   - [ ] Check constructor arguments
   - [ ] Verify contract source code
   - [ ] Check compiler settings
   - [ ] Verify network explorer status

3. **If frontend integration fails**
   - [ ] Verify contract addresses
   - [ ] Check ABI compatibility
   - [ ] Verify network configuration
   - [ ] Test contract interactions
