I am working on a blockchain/Web3-based application with several unfinished or partially implemented components across the codebase.

Your task is to:

Scan and analyze all code files (smart contracts, frontend, backend, integrations, etc.) to identify all unfinished, broken, or improperly implemented parts—especially those that relate to blockchain/Web3 interactions.

Provide a clear, structured audit report detailing:

What’s missing or incomplete.

What needs to be corrected or refactored.

What dependencies or external services (e.g., wallets, RPCs, APIs, IPFS, etc.) are required or improperly configured.

Recommend and implement fixes or completions for each issue.

Deliver a fully working version of the product, including:

Full on-chain/off-chain integration.

Proper wallet support (e.g., Metamask, WalletConnect, etc.).

Deployment-ready smart contracts.

Clean, tested code across all layers (smart contract, backend, frontend).

Deployment or build instructions, if needed.

Be meticulous—treat this as a production-ready project audit and delivery process. Leave helpful code comments where applicable.
